FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and microservices
- using this middle end, when client sents requests we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request
- We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting
- We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as the middle end.
